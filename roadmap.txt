Phase 1:
=========
1. Writing Hexidecimal 
2. The Magic Boot Number
3. Writing a valid bootloader in Hex
4. Experiment writing valid bootloader in ASM (traslate Hex -> ASM)
5. Ambitious: Look at printing data

Phase 2:
=========
1. Introduction to the ASM bootloader, inspect HEX
2. Data vs. Code in Binary files..
3. Defining data in ASM
4. Introduction to Interrupts & BIOS calls

<Where does setting up the stack go? Before or after reading from BIOS?>

Phase 3:
========
1. What does the 1st stage bootloader need to do?
2. Understanding Memory addressing and limitations.
3. Defining a memory map for the inital bootloader and Kernel
4. Using BIOS to read data from a disk to disk buffer
5. Reading that new sector (FAT Filesystem?)

Phase 4:
========
1. Setting BIOS in VBE Mode. Other BIOS Video Modes.
2. Setting up the A20 line for the kernel.
3. GDT
4. Boot02 detecting memory map from BIOS
