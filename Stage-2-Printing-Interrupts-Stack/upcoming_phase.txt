In the upcoming phase, we will lay out a memory map for the first stage bootloader, allowing us to specify a space 
where we will put the contents of the disk before moving it (boot_stage_2) to another location in memory. Further,
we will learn how to read contents from disk using BIOS interrupts. 

Further the experiment in this phase included trying to setup a stack and 
push/pop all params before calling anything. This is still in progress.
