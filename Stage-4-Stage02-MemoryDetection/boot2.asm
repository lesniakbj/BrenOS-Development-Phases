; NOTE:
; ======================
; Some emulators and disk drives will
; not read a sector unless it is fully 
; padded out, thus we need to pad this
; sector or it will not be read. This is
; true of all sectors we read in some 
; emulators. Thus, the last sector of every
; code segment must be padded.
