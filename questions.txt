1. What calling convention should I use when calling assembly functions?
		a. Is _cdecl the standard to use if using GCC?
		b. What happens in the event of VARARGS in the parameter list?
		c. Register based calling seems the quickest, while stack based calling seems
		   to be the most robust, which context is each of these appropriate in?
